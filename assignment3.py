# area = 3.142 * radius * radius
# print(area)

# 5. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in
# reverse order with a space between them.

# b = sum(thislist)
# print (b)


# 11.Write a Python program to get the largest number from a numeric list.

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 6, 101, 55, 7, 1, 3, 88, 99, 101, 6, 88, 66, 6, 101, 55, 1001]
# print(max(numbers))




# 12. Take a list, say for example this one:
# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# Write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

# new_list = []

# for item in a:
#     if item < 5:
#         new_list.append(item)
# print(new_list)
